            <br>
            After being a cameraman for 4 years in the Media sector I have realised that altough the job is great and a lot of
            fun I don't want to do it
            untill my retirement. I have had an interest in Software en PC's from a younger age when I loved to game and build
            computers.
            The ICT education was therefore my most interesting education to pick and now I am attending it! Hence this
            website. <br><br>

            I think this education suits me because I have an interest for Computers and coding from when I was young. I used
            to build PC's and edit my
            own little lines of code in old Minecraft servers. Toghether with the motivation for the future I am sure this
            will work out.<br><br>

            This website is a showcase of the basic skills that I have for HTML and CSS!
