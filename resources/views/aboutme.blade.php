    <p> Hi! My name is Dimitrie Lauer and I am a freelance Camera-Operator and Learning Software Developer. <br>
        I have started my camera journey when I was 15 years old. After 4 years of education on the "Curio College" I
        started working at EMG Nederland the biggest broadcast facilitatior in the Netherlands,
        now after 3 years of working at EMG I have decided to become a Freelancer! <br> <br>
        In 2022 I applied to the HZ University of Applied Science to study HBO-ICT witch I am studying right now! <br>
        This web page is a starting project of mine in my first year.
        I have always had an interest in software and coding so now I am following that passion aswell with this new
        education! <br> <br>
        I am a huge space enthousiast and I like to game a lot, in my free time I play a lot of competetive FIFA Pro Clubs
        and from time to time I like to play milsimulator games. <br> <br>
        Here below you can find a video of what kind of work I did/do!</p>
